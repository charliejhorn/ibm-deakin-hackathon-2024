{"text": "SMSF borrowing to purchase property: Borrowing or gearing your super into property involves very strict borrowing conditions. It's called a 'limited recourse borrowing arrangement' (LRBA). You can only purchase a single asset with a LRBA. For example, a residential or commercial property. The ATO has more information about limited recourse borrowing arrangements. You should assess whether investing in property is consistent with the investment strategy and risk profile of your SMSF. Borrowing adds complexity to your SMSF, so it's important to get advice from a licensed financial adviser. Ask the financial adviser to explain the following risks. SMSF property risks include: Higher costs \u2013 SMSF property loans tend to be more costly than other property loans. Cash flow \u2013 Your fund must always have sufficient liquidity or cash flow to meet expenses. These may include the loan repayments, insurance premiums for the property and other property expenses such as rates or property management. The fund may also need to allow for retirement pension payments or lump sum withdrawals. Loan balance - You need to ensure there is a strategy in place to repay the loan in the event of illness, disability or death of members, or rental vacancy. Hard to cancel \u2013 If your SMSF property loan documents and contract aren't set up correctly, you can't unwind the arrangement. You may have to sell the property, potentially causing substantial losses to the SMSF. Possible tax losses \u2013 You can't offset tax losses from the property against your taxable income outside the fund. No alterations to the property \u2013 You can't make alterations that change the character of the property until you pay off the SMSF property loan. See borrowing to invest for more information on the risks of gearing."}
{"text": "Property developers and SMSFs: Property developers must have an AFS licence if they provide financial advice. Financial advice includes advice on setting up an SMSF. Property developers may have a pre-existing business relationship with the professionals they recommended. They may receive a referral fee or other benefits that could amount to thousands of dollars. Don't be pressured into making property purchase decisions for an SMSF. Watch out for sales tactics like competitions, free flights to sales meetings or being taken out for free meals. Think twice about investing in property markets you are not familiar with. Do your own research first. Make sure you get financial advice from someone who has an AFS licence. See questions to ask a financial adviser for talking points you can use to check for sales incentives."}
{"text": "Director fraud occurs where a director of a company uses investors' funds for personal gain. It may also be called director theft or misappropriation of funds. It's a criminal offence for a director of a company to misuse investors' money for personal gain. When this happens, investors can lose some or all of their investment."}
{"text": "Warning signs of director fraud: There are some common signs that may indicate something is not right with the company you have invested in. This can be when the company: continually raises funds, but it isn't clear what it's using the funds for, doesn't release updates on their exploration or research and development (R&D) activities, pays large consulting or service fees to related parties, accounts have many unexplained or unusual expenses, takes on loans, asset sales or purchase agreements with related parties where there is no clear business purpose"}
{"text": "Illegal phoenix activity occurs when a director of a company that can't pay its debts transfers the company's assets to a new company for little or no payment. Directors take this action to avoid paying creditors of the old company when it's liquidated."}
{"text": "How to protect your investments: Minimise your chance of loss by researching companies before and after you invest. Before you invest: If the company is issuing new shares on the market, read the prospectus carefully.; Research the company's business and the directors (including other directorships they hold or have held). Search ASIC Connect's Professional Registers and check the list of companies you should not deal with.; Read the company's financial statements and remuneration report.; Check if anyone recommending the investment has a personal involvement in the company or will receive any benefits.; Seek independent financial advice if you're not sure.; See choosing shares to buy for more information on researching companies."}
{"text": "After you invest: When you've invested money in a business, monitor the company's progress by: reading the company's annual report, checking for any continuous disclosure announcements to identify red flags, attending the company's annual general meeting to ask the directors questions. Find out the other things you can do to keep track of your investments."}

{"text": "Land banking is a real estate investment scheme that involves buying large blocks of undeveloped land. These schemes are often unregulated and there's little protection if something goes wrong. In a land banking scheme, property developers usually buy land, divide it into smaller blocks and offer it to investors. As an investor, you either buy a plot of land or buy an option to purchase a plot of land. These are known as 'option agreements'. The option agreement is usually triggered when the land has been approved for development by the local council. The land is expected to be sold at a profit when it's rezoned or approved for development."}
{"text": "Land banking schemes sold at property seminars: You might hear about land banking at property spruiking or investment seminars. They are described as a 'get rich slow' option. Glossy brochures and presentations promote land banking as a cheaper way to get into the property market. Property spruiking events and investment seminars are often high-pressure environments. You can be rushed into making a decision. You may not be given enough time to consider the investment carefully or to seek independent advice before you sign up."}
{"text": "How land banking schemes go wrong: The land is undeveloped: Developers can mislead investors about the prospects of rezoning or developing the land. Some developers offer land for investment without knowing whether they can get council approval to develop it. Some have failed to tell investors that there are development restrictions on the land. If the land doesn't get development approval, your investment could be unsaleable and worth less than you paid; Schemes can collapse: A number of land banking schemes have collapsed in Australia and overseas without the promoted development ever proceeding. Planning approval can take many years and lots of money. Ongoing legal and planning costs can eat into the funds to support the development. This can cause the company to become insolvent. If you're an option holder, you can lose all the money you've invested; Option agreements can expire: Some land banking option agreements have a 'sunset clause'. The sunset clause ends the scheme 20 to 25 years from the date of the agreement, if the land fails to be rezoned or developed. The sunset clause can mean investors lose the fee they paid if there's not enough money to repay all option holders. You may not get a refund on any legal fees, commissions and other payments you paid; Land banking scams: Investors may be scammed by developers who are selling options in land they do not own; Legal or financial advice kickbacks: Land banking scheme promoters may refer you to lawyers, accountants or financial advisers. Be aware that they may have a pre-existing business relationship with the promoter or developer, who may receive a kickback for referring you. And, they could have a personal interest in the property development. Always seek independent legal or financial advice. ASIC has taken action against land banking schemes run by Askk Investment Group, VKK Investments Unit Trust, Realestate Equity Investment Trust (REIT), 21st Century land banking companies and Midland Hwy."}
{"text": "What to check before investing in land banking: Contact the local council: Ask the local council if the land will ever be released for development. A land banking promoter may try to persuade you that the council is not aware of all potential developments. You should question the promoter's motivation for telling you this; Check if it's a managed investment scheme: Managed investment scheme operators need an Australian financial services (AFS) licence. The scheme may be a managed investment scheme if: Investors do not have day-to-day control over managing their investment, The scheme involves pooling investor funds, The funds are used to further the development. You can check ASIC Connect's Professional Registers to see if the developer and the promoter hold an AFS licence; Read the product disclosure statement (PDS):"}
{"text": "If it is a managed investment scheme, you must be given a product disclosure statement (PDS). The PDS must include information about the scheme's key features, fees, commissions, benefits, risks and complaints handling procedure. Make sure you read the PDS. If you don't understand the investment, get independent financial or legal advice. Do not confuse the PDS with marketing material used to sell the investment, such as brochures or information sheets."}
{"text": "Be wary of invitations to events and seminars offering the financial secrets to make you rich. Over-hyped and misleading claims can lead to expensive, high-risk investments that lose you money."}
{"text": "Slick salespeople might be unqualified: Seminars can promise a motivational speaker who claims to be a self-made millionaire. The speaker will share their secrets to financial success. These speakers may be unregistered and unqualified to provide financial advice. Check that anyone offering you investment advice has an Australian financial services (AFS) licence."}
{"text": "Big promises mean big investment risks: Stay away from investment seminars that promise: risk-free investments, to make you a millionaire in a few years, above average returns at little or no risk, government-approved investments. Look at the strategies they suggest to achieve the great results they promise. Shares have return around 7% a year, and property about 6% a year, over the last decade. If you're offered returns of 1-2% more (or a lot higher) than these returns: get a second opinion, and ask for a detailed written explanation. Property deals offered at these seminars might include 'rent guarantees' or 'discounts' for buying off the plan. Be careful as they can involve hidden fees and commissions. The properties can also be over-valued. Some seminars promote schemes that involve you lending money with little or no security. Another twist is to get you to invest in offshore schemes where you lose the protection of Australian laws. You may never see your money again."}
{"text": "High fees but small returns: Investment seminars often don't deliver any concrete investment opportunities. The first event may be free. But expect pressure to buy reports or books and 'sign up' for more expensive seminars or educational courses. The only person making any money will be the seminar organiser."}
{"text": "Check the scheme is legal: Check if the promoters of the investment scheme: appear on ASIC Connect professional registers \u2014 search under 'banned and disqualified', are on the ACCC's undertakings registers and if they have taken any action against them, have had any action taken against them by your state or territory consumer affairs and protection agency. Even if the seminar provider doesn't show up in these checks, the scheme may not be safe or legal."}
{"text": "Get financial advice before you invest: Never make any decisions about money or investments on the spot. The atmosphere at these events can be exciting \u2014 but they\u2019re not designed for you to make rational decisions. Seek financial advice from someone not linked to the seminar. If you want to attend seminars, consider reputable providers like the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) and Service Australia's Financial information service."}
{"text": "Report suspicious activities: If a seminar doesn't seem right or you think you have invested in a scam, report it to ASIC. And warn family and friends so they don't fall for the same deal."}
{"text": "Listed investment companies (LICs) and listed investment trusts (LITs) offer exposure to a broader range of assets per transaction. The investing approach and underlying assets will vary. So make sure you understand how the company or trust is investing your money."}
{"text": "How LICs and LITs work: Listed investment companies (LICs) A LIC is an investment, listed on an exchange such as the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). It is incorporated as a company. Many LICs operate like a managed fund. They have an external or internal fund manager, who selects and manages the company's investments. LICs are 'closed-ended'. This means they don't issue new shares, or cancel existing shares, as investors join or leave. Instead, they issue a fixed number of shares in an initial public offering (IPO). Investors then buy and sell those shares on the exchange. This allows a fund manager to focus on investing, without having to worry about cash flow. As LICs are companies, they may pay franked dividends; Listed investment trusts (LITs): A LIT is an investment listed on an exchange such as ASX, incorporated as a trust. LITs are also closed-ended funds. So investors buy and sell units on the exchange. LITs pay out any surplus income to investors as trust distributions, according to the underlying investments. Franking levels may vary, depending on the income distributed from the underlying assets."}
{"text": "Check the underlying investments: Older LICs and LITs typically invest in either Australian or international shares. Newer funds offer exposure to a broader range of underlying assets, to suit different types of investors. Categories of LICs and LITs: Based on their investment style, LICs and LITs sit in four broad categories: Australian shares funds \u2014 invest mostly in listed Australian shares, International shares funds \u2014 invest mostly in shares listed on overseas exchanges, Private equity funds \u2014 invest in unlisted companies, locally or overseas, Specialist funds \u2014 invest in special assets or particular sectors such as wineries, technology companies, infrastructure or property; Investment strategies: The investment approach of each fund varies, from conservative to aggressive. While aggressive funds may generate higher returns, they can also be higher risk. Some of the riskier strategies funds may use include short selling, leverage and derivatives. Consider whether the fund's structure, investing style and underlying portfolio suits your needs and objectives before you invest; Investment time frame: This type of investment suits a medium to long-term time frame (5 years or more). This is because of the potential for volatility of the underlying assets."}
{"text": "How to buy and sell LICs and LITs: You can buy or sell LICs and LITs on ASX, through a broker or online trading account. So, as with ordinary shares, you pay a broking fee when you buy or sell. Net tangible asset (NTA) backing: LICs and LITs usually trade at either a discount or premium to their net tangible asset (NTA) backing. The NTA is a company's physical assets, less its liabilities. This means a share may trade at more or less than the value of the underlying assets per share. Long established funds, with a history of good investment management, often trade at a premium. Newer funds are more likely to trade at a discount; Management and performance fees: Fees paid to the fund manager may include: a management fee (commonly 1-1.5% of net assets), a performance fee (commonly 15-20% of returns above a set benchmark). Management fees are payable regardless of how well the fund performs. Some funds don't charge a performance fee. On others, the performance fee may be payable even if the fund makes a negative return. As long as the return is above the benchmark."}
