{"text": "Borrowing to invest, also known as gearing or leverage, involves using borrowed funds to purchase investments. This strategy can amplify returns when markets rise but also magnify losses when markets fall. It's a high-risk approach suitable primarily for experienced investors."}
{"text": "Key risks of borrowing to invest include: 1) Increased returns and losses - Borrowing can lead to higher returns in a rising market but larger losses if the market declines. 2) Capital risk - If the value of your investment decreases, you may owe more than the investment is worth. 3) Income risk - The investment might not generate the expected income, affecting your ability to cover loan repayments. 4) Interest rate risk - An increase in interest rates can raise borrowing costs, impacting the profitability of your investment."}
{"text": "Negative gearing occurs when the income from an investment is less than the expenses, including interest on the loan. This results in a loss, which can sometimes be used to reduce taxable income. However, making a loss means the investment is costing you money. The strategy relies on the investment's value increasing over time to offset these losses."}
{"text": "Before borrowing to invest, consider the following: 1) Assess your financial situation to ensure you can meet loan repayments without relying solely on investment income. 2) Understand the risks, including the potential for significant losses and the impact of interest rate changes. 3) Seek professional advice from a licensed financial adviser to determine if this strategy aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance."}
{"text": "Developing an investing plan involves six key steps: 1) Review your finances to understand your current financial situation. 2) Set your financial goals, specifying how much you'll need and the time frame to achieve them. 3) Understand investment risks to determine your risk tolerance. 4) Research different investment options to find those that align with your goals and risk tolerance. 5) Build your portfolio by selecting a mix of investments that suit your objectives. 6) Monitor your investments regularly to ensure they remain aligned with your financial goals."}
{"text": "Before investing, review your financial situation by listing your debts and assets, including superannuation, home, savings, and other investments.

{"text": "A managed fund is a type of investment where your money is pooled together with other investors. A fund manager then buys and sells assets, such as cash, shares, bonds and listed property trusts, on your behalf. Managed investment schemes and Corporate Collective Investment Vehicles (CCIVs) are different types of managed funds.  You don't own the underlying investments, you own 'units' in the fund or 'shares' in the CCIV. The value of the units or shares will rise and fall with the value of the underlying assets. Some managed funds also pay income or 'distributions'. We explain the types of managed funds you can invest in and what to look for to find the best managed fund for you."}

Here are the main single asset managed funds you can invest in: Cash funds: Invests in very low-risk, short-term investments. These can include short-term money market deposits, short-term government bonds and bank bills. Fixed interest or bond funds: Generally invest in low-risk investments. These can include government bonds, bank bills, or mortgage-backed securities. Some funds invest in corporate bonds and can be higher risk. Mortgage funds: Invests in property loans (mortgages). Some funds are high risk. The fund's risk depends on the quality of the borrowers and purpose of the loan. You receive income as long as the borrower pays interest. Your investment doesn't increase in value. It can fall in value if borrowers can't repay their loans. Property funds: Invests in residential property, commercial property or property developments. Some property funds are high risk. You might not be able to withdraw your money from the fund at short notice. You're not guaranteed a fixed rate of interest or return. Share (equity) funds: Invests in listed companies in Australia, overseas or both. These funds offer the potential for higher returns but also have higher risk.

{"text": "Compare managed funds: Check the PDS: A product disclosure statement (PDS) contains all the information you need to know about a fund and to compare funds. It includes information on: what assets the funds invests in, the fees, the risks of investing in the fund, the benchmark or target return , how to complain if you have a problem; Look at long-term returns: If a fund performs well in one year, there's no guarantee it will the next year. A fund's performance over 5 to 10 years gives you a better indication of how it will perform in the future. You should compare the returns of a managed fund or portfolio offered in a managed account against: an index fund \u2013 to see if it's keeping pace with the relevant market, for example the ASX200, other similar funds \u2013 to see how it's performing against competing funds. You can check how a managed fund has performed by using the Fund Screener on the Morningstar website. You can search for funds based on returns, fees and where they invest. A managed fund's PDS will tell you the minimum amount of time you should invest for and risk level of the fund. Make sure this lines up with how long you're planning to invest and your risk tolerance; Review the risks: Each managed fund has different risks based on the assets they invest in. Risk is the likelihood that you'll lose some or all the money you've invested. You can find information on the risks of investing in a managed fund in the PDS. Some risks to look out for when investing in a managed fund are: Funds use different names and labels. For example, 'low risk', 'capital protected' or 'stable'. These may not reflect the risk of the fund. Some funds invest in assets that are not liquid. These funds may not be able to redeem units or shares in the fund easily or at the price that is equal to the unit or share price. Some funds also don't hold assets directly, they invest in other managed funds; Check the managed fund fees: Managed funds charge a range of fees for managing your money. Small differences in fees can have a large impact on your returns.These are the common fees you should check before you invest. Establishment fee \u2013 the fee to open your investment. This is usually between 0% and 5% of the amount you invest.Contribution fee \u2013 the fee on each amount contributed to your investment. It is usually between 0% to 5%. Management fees and costs \u2013 the fees and costs for managing your investment. It is typically between 0.5% and 2.5% per year. It's deducted from your account balance. Performance fee \u2013 an extra fee a fund manager may charge if the investment return is better than the benchmark or target return. Adviser service fee \u2013 ongoing fee paid to your financial adviser for arranging the investment. It's typically between 1 to 2% per year. The scheme may also charge you fees for transactions, withdrawals, to change investment options or exit the scheme. Fees reduce the returns of a managed fund. They can also increase in the size of losses as they are charged regardless of whether the fund makes a profit or a loss. You may be able to negotiate the fees you pay with fund manager or your adviser."}
{"text": "Buying units or shares in a managed fund: When you invest in a managed fund you are buying 'units' in the managed investment scheme or 'shares' in the CCIV. The number of units or shares you get depends on the unit or share price at the time you invest. The unit or share price changes depending on the value of the assets the fund invests in. With most managed funds, you'll need a minimum amount to invest, for example $5,000. Unlisted and listed managed funds: Unlisted managed funds \u2013 most managed funds are not listed on an exchange. You buy units or shares in the fund by sending an application form to a fund or by visiting the ASX's mFund service. Listed managed funds \u2013 you can buy and sell units or shares in the fund on an exchange, such as the ASX. The unit or share price of a listed managed fund can be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV) of the fund."}
{"text": "Withdrawing your money from a managed fund: Managed funds can have fees or restrictions on when you can withdraw your money. Some funds won't allow you to withdraw your money until a certain point in time. For example, 12 months after your investment. Other funds may freeze or stop withdrawals to protect all the members\u2019 investments. Stopping withdrawals until the market settles means the fund can avoid selling assets at lower values. Distributions such as income payments might continue from a frozen fund. You can find information on withdrawal rights in the fund's PDS. If you're having trouble withdrawing your money beyond the stated fund restrictions, you can complain. Hardship withdrawals from frozen funds: If your money is in a frozen fund and you're finding it hard to pay your regular bills, you may be able to withdraw some, or all, of your money. If your fund manager offers hardship withdrawals to all investors, you can apply for a hardship withdrawal if: you cannot meet reasonable and immediate living expense, you are unemployed for at least 3 months and have no other means of financial support (except government assistance), you\u2019re applying under compassionate grounds (for example, medical costs for serious illness), you have suffered permanent incapacity. If you meet the hardship criteria, the fund manager may approve that you can: withdraw up to a total of $100,000 per calendar year, and receive up to four withdrawals per calendar year Your fund manager will let you know whether a fund is frozen. Contact them to apply for a hardship withdrawal. ASIC provides more information on frozen funds and hardship withdrawals."}
{"text": "Keep track of your managed fund's performance: By law, your fund manager must update you on the fund's performance at least once every 12 months.

{"text": "Timeshare schemes are a form of ownership or right to use a particular property or properties for holidays. It\u2019s important to understand how they work before you sign up. They are a long-term commitment and can be hard to sell."}
{"text": "How timeshares work: There are two types of timeshare schemes. Specific time-period schemes \u2013 you can use a specific property for a given time, such as one week a year. Points-based schemes \u2013 you buy points to redeem at different resorts or holiday accommodation properties, or for other travel services. Timeshares vary in price depending on the: time or points purchased, location, standard of accommodation. Timeshare use can cost more in peak periods, such as school holidays or around public holidays. You may be able to rent your timeshare property out if you don't plan to use it. You can also 'swap' or 'bank' your timeshares through a timeshare website. Timeshares are a financial product: Timeshare schemes are a type of managed fund. This means that the scheme operator must: hold an Australian financial services (AFS) licence, register the scheme with ASIC, give you a product disclosure statement (PDS). Before you buy into a timeshare, check the company has an AFS licence on ASIC Connect's Professional Registers. If they don't have one, don't deal with them."}
{"text": "What to watch out for with timeshares: Before you sign up to a timeshare membership, fully understand what you're getting. Timeshare seminars: Timeshare memberships are usually bought following a 2-3 hour sales seminar. They may offer a 'gift' to attend the seminar, and describe timeshares as 'free or cheap holidays'. After the pitch, high pressure sales techniques will be used to try and get you to sign up before you leave. You don't have to sign up to a timeshare on the day. Take time to consider the costs, and weigh up if you will use the holiday property enough to justify what you pay. If you buy a timeshare, you have the right to a 7 day cooling-off period. It's 14 days if the operator is not a member of the Australian Timeshare and Holiday Ownership Council (ATHOC). If you change your mind, tell them in writing before the end of the period; Costs of timeshare schemes: The upfront cost to buy a timeshare can be high, in some cases over $20,000. On top of this, you pay an annual maintenance fee for the property, even if you don't use it. You may also have to pay a membership fee each year. The PDS outlines all the costs. Add these up for the whole contract term to find the total cost. Then compare these costs against other holiday options; Borrowing money to buy a timeshare: Banks don't generally lend money to buy into timeshare schemes. Scheme operators may offer credit to help you buy a timeshare, but interest rates can be high."}
{"text": "Be sure to read and understand all the terms of the credit contract. Before you sign a credit contract check the: interest rate, fees, cost of repayments and cooling-off period. Check they're licensed to provide credit by searching ASIC Connect's Professional Registers; Long-term contracts: Timeshares are long-term commitments and the contract can be over 60 years long. They are often sold as investments you can pass on to your family. But consider if your family would want or could afford the ongoing costs of a timeshare; Timeshare expectations may not be met: A 2019 ASIC report on timeshares showed many consumers felt that they were not getting the expected value from their membership. Consumers had experienced financial stress because of unexpected changes to timeshare membership fees, or in some cases, to their personal circumstances."}
{"text": "Getting out of a timeshare: The main way to get out of a timeshare is to sell it. To do this you'll have to make sure all fees are paid. However, timeshares can be very hard to sell. Most people make a loss when they sell them. When you buy a timeshare you sign a contract to pay the costs. So you can't just stop paying for it. If you do, you may be in breach of contract and could face legal action. Financial hardship: If you are in financial hardship, ask your provider to let you out of the scheme. Each provider will assess the owner's situation and will require evidence of hardship. They are under no obligation to release you from the contract."}
{"text": "Problems with timeshares: Timeshare operators must be members of an external dispute resolution scheme. If you have a dispute that involves a timeshare operator, contact the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) to make a complaint and get free, independent dispute resolution."}
{"text": "Contracts for difference (CFDs) let you speculate on short-term market movements. Like foreign exchange rates, share prices, stock market index levels, cryptocurrency rates or other underlying assets. Most people lose money trading CFDs.Your gain or loss depends on the price of the underlying asset when the contract starts and ends. If the price moves in your favour, the CFD provider pays you. If the price moves against your CFD position, you pay the provider."}
{"text": "What is CFD trading: A CFD is a derivative, which means its value is based on another asset, like a share or index. But, unlike shares, when you trade a CFD you don't own the underlying asset. Instead, you speculate on its price movement. You agree to pay the difference in price of the underlying asset between when the contract opens and closes: if you 'buy' a CFD (a 'long trade'), you expect the value of the asset to increase, and if you 'sell' a CFD (a 'short trade'), you expect the value of the asset to fall. You pay transaction costs and other fees to the CFD provider. A CFD contract is legally binding. If the market goes against you, the CFD provider: will ask you to pay extra money at short notice to keep your CFD position open (a 'margin call'). This may lead to further losses; may close out your CFD, for whatever it's worth at the time. You may lose all the money you invested. CFD contracts are not all the same. Every CFD provider has their own terms and conditions. You rely on the provider to fulfil their obligations to you. Look for details in the product disclosure statement (PDS) and terms and conditions. There are restrictions on the sale of CFDs to retail investors in Australia."}
{"text": "Providers must: apply 'margin close-out protection', to end one or more open CFDs before all or most of the investment is lost, and limit retail client losses by providing 'negative balance protection', so they can never lose more than they invest. They must not: exceed specific leverage ratio limits, depending on the CFD asset class, or offer incentives to trade CFDs, such as trading credits and rebates, or 'free' gifts like iPads"}
{"text": "Why CFDs are high risk: CFDs are complex and high risk. Even experienced investors may struggle to understand the risks and complexities of trading CFDs. Most retail clients lose money trading CFDs. Consider whether you can afford to lose your money. Leverage can lead to large losses: CFD leverage is like trading with borrowed money. The deposit (or 'margin') you give to the provider is a small part of what you borrow to invest. Leveraging and trading on margin is highly risky. A small price change against your CFD position can have a big effect on your trading returns or losses. You can quickly lose your entire investment. For example, you may have to put up $5,000 (5%) for a $100,000 contract. This means you are borrowing the other 95%. A 5% change in the underlying asset price could mean you lose your $5,000; Consumer protection may not apply with overseas CFD providers: CFD providers operating in Australia must have an Australian financial services (AFS) licence. Overseas CFD providers often don't hold an AFS licence, so consumer protection under Australian laws will not apply. This means you will not have access to independent dispute resolution through the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA). If something goes wrong, you may not be able to get help. If the overseas provider does not hold an AFS licence, it could be a scam; Wholesale clients lose consumer protection: Some firms may try to classify you as a 'wholesale client', rather than a retail client. They could ask you to sign up to a 'pro-account' and describe the benefits. But if you're a wholesale client, you: may not have 'negative balance protection' or 'margin close-out protection' on your CFD so you could lose more than the amount you invest, waive your right to use the CFD provider's internal dispute resolution service, cannot get external dispute resolution through AFCA, may not receive a product disclosure statement (PDS) or financial services guide for the CFD, will not be assessed to see if you fit the licensee\u2019s target market. To check how you are classified, read the PDS issued by the CFD provider."}
{"text": "How CFDs are distributed: Only a licensed CFD provider can issue CFDs to retail clients in Australia. That means your CFD contract is with the provider, and you pay them for the transaction. An authorised representative or introducing broker can tell you about CFDs, but they cannot sell them to you directly: Authorised representative \u2013 arranges for a licensed CFD provider to issue CFDs to you, Introducing broker \u2013 must be licensed or authorised by a licensee, and arranges for a licensed CFD provider to issue CFDs to you. They are typically paid a referral fee for your business by the CFD provider. Always check that the product is issued by a licensed CFD provider, by reading the PDS."}
{"text": "Companies use debentures, secured and unsecured notes to raise money from investors. They offer fixed interest payments but returns often depend on risky investments. You could lose all your money if the company or investment fails."}
{"text": "How debentures, secured and unsecured notes work: Companies set the interest rate on the debentures, secured and unsecured notes in advance. In return, the company promises to: make regular interest payments, and return the money ('the capital') you lend them at a date in the future, Companies use debentures because they are a cheap way for them to borrow money. They have lower interest rates and longer repayment dates compared to other types of loans."}
{"text": "What companies do with your money: The company might use your money to finance a range of investment activities. Or it may on-lend your money to another business. The security offered by the company determines the name of the investment. Debentures \u2013 if 'tangible property' (real estate, land, equipment, for example) is offered as security. Secured notes \u2013 if a 'first ranking' debt over other property is offered as security. Unsecured notes \u2013 no security offered."}
{"text": "The risks of debentures, secured and unsecured notes: Debentures, secured and unsecured notes offer higher interest rates than bank deposits. They also carry higher risks. No guaranteed returns: There's no guarantee the company will pay you interest. Or return your capital. You could lose all the money you've invested if the company or project fails; Money locked away: Debentures and notes have set investment periods, for example 1, 3, 6 or 12 months. Some have a set period of 5 years. You cannot ask for your money back before the set period expires, unless they are 'at call'. Some companies may repay your money early on hardship or compassionate grounds. There is usually a penalty for getting your money early; Unlisted investments can be hard to sell: Debentures, secured and unsecured notes are 'unlisted' investments. This means you can't buy and sell them on a market like the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Instead, you deal directly with the company issuing the debentures and notes. Because the debentures are unlisted: you can't see if the price of the investment is going up or down, and it may be difficult to sell them if you decide you no longer want them."}
{"text": "What to check before buying debentures and notes: There are a few things you can do to understand the investment and the risks. Read the prospectus: The prospectus tells you how the company will use your money. For example, will they use it to finance their own investments? Or will they on-lend your money to another business? The prospectus will also tell you the return being offered to investors. Will it compensate for the risks? Get financial advice if you need help understanding the prospectus; Understand the business model: How does the company make its money? What are they going to do with your money? If you can't explain these things to a friend, stick to a safer investment where the risks are clearer; Rollovers: Before the end of the set period, the company will contact you about extending your investment. If you do nothing, the company will 'rollover' the debenture for the same period as the original investment. You will not be able to access your money until the end of the new period. The company's business or financial position may have changed since you lasted invested. Check their financial report for the year to assess the value of your investment.

{"text": "Peer to peer (P2P) lending matches people with money to invest and people looking for a loan. Make sure you understand how the investment works. Consider whether it suits your needs and goals before you invest."}
{"text": "How peer to peer (P2P) lending works: P2P (or marketplace) lending lets someone needing a personal or business loan borrow money from an investor. Instead of going through a lender such as a bank, building society or credit union. The borrower takes out a loan \u2014 and repays it over time, with interest. When you invest via P2P lending, you buy a financial product. This is typically a managed fund. P2P lending platform: A P2P lender operates an online platform. The platform operator acts as intermediary between investor and borrower. It makes money by charging fees to both; Interest rate: As an investor, P2P lending may offer you an attractive interest rate. The rate, and how the platform operator calculates it, can vary; How to invest: You decide how much money you want to invest. Depending on the lending platform, you may be able to decide how your money is used. For example, you could choose to fund a particular loan. Or invest in a portfolio of loans. You may also be able to choose the minimum interest rate, and a loan period to suit. Alternatively, the platform operator or fund manager may make the investment decisions; Return of capital: The platform operator collects borrower repayments and passes them on to investors at set intervals. You may get your capital back via repayments, or at the end of the loan period; Lending risk: When a borrower applies for a loan, the platform operator does a credit history check. The platform operator assesses lending risk and repayment capacity; Privacy: The platform operator looks after the privacy of platform user information."}
{"text": "Pros and cons of P2P lending: To decide if investing in P2P lending is right for you, consider the following: Pros: Interest rate \u2014 may offer a higher rate of return, compared to some other types of investing. Accessibility \u2014 an online platform can make transacting easy and accessible. The idea of your money going to someone needing a loan, while making money yourself, could also appeal; Cons: Lending risk \u2014 many P2P loans are unsecured. The platform operator may not disclose the lending risk of each borrower. If the operator doesn't lend any of their own money, the lending risk is on you, the investor. You could lose some or all of your money even if you invest in a 'low-risk' loan."}
{"text": "Assessing credit risk \u2014 how the platform operator assesses a borrower's ability to repay can vary between platforms. The result may be less robust than a credit rating from an external credit reporting agency. The borrower may fail to repay the loan \u2014 borrower circumstances can change. For example, illness or unemployment may mean they are unable to keep up repayments. In such a case, the borrower can apply for a hardship variation. So the size or timing of repayments could alter. If the loan term extends, you may get a lower return than expected. No government protection \u2014 investing via P2P lending is not like depositing money in a bank. There is no government guarantee on funds. For example, if your investment is lost due to fraud or a lending platform error, you may have no option for compensation. Adequacy of compensation \u2014 even if an operator sets aside funds to compensate investors, there may not be enough to compensate everyone."}
{"text": "What to check before you invest in P2P lending: Check the platform operator is licensed: Make sure the platform operator has an Australian financial services (AFS) licence. Search the following two lists on ASIC Connect's Professional Registers: Australian financial services licensee, Australian financial services authorised representative. If the operator isn't on one of these lists, it could be operating illegally; Check the managed fund is registered: A P2P lending platform is typically a managed fund (managed investment scheme). Check the fund is registered with ASIC. Search 'Organisation and Business Names' on ASIC Connect's Professional Registers. To search, choose the list name in the 'Search Within' drop-down menu. An unregistered managed fund offers fewer protections than a registered fund; Read the product disclosure statement: Get the fund's product disclosure statement (PDS) before you invest. This sets out the features, benefits, costs and risks of the fund. Make sure you understand the investment; Check the fund's features: Use these questions to check the features of the fund: Security \u2014 Are loans secured or unsecured? Interest rate \u2014 How is the interest rate set? Who decides this? Choice of loans \u2014 Can you choose a specific loan or borrower? Can you invest in several loans or borrowers, to reduce the risk of losing all your money? Repayments \u2014 How long will it take to get any money back? Getting your money back \u2014 Do you have cooling off rights, if you change your mind? If so, can you get your money back? Risk assessment \u2014 What is the operator's track record of assessing borrower risk? For example, a high number of defaults or late repayments may indicate a poor credit assessment process. What if the borrower defaults \u2014 How will the operator recover your investment? Who pays the expense of any recovery action? What if the platform fails \u2014 What happens if the operator becomes insolvent or goes into external administration? Fees \u2014 What fees do you have to pay the operator? For example, to invest, handle repayments or access your money early. Consider whether the fund suits your needs and objectives before you invest."}

{"text": "Exchange traded funds (ETFs) are a low-cost way to earn a return similar to an index or a commodity. They can also help to diversify your investments. You can buy and sell units in ETFs through a stockbroker, the same way you buy and sell shares."}
{"text": "How ETFs work: An ETF is a managed fund that you can buy or sell on an exchange, like the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) or Cboe Australia (CXA).  When you invest in an ETF, you don't own the underlying investments. You own units in the ETF and the ETF provider owns the shares or assets. ETF units can be created or redeemed to match investor demand. This helps the price of the units to stay close to the net asset value (NAV) of the ETF. This differs from shares in a company or units in a Listed Investment Trust, where the price fluctuates based on investor demand. The ASX ETF investor course can help you learn more about how ETFs work."}
{"text": "Types of ETFs: Passively managed ETFs: In Australia, most ETFs are passive investments that don't try to outperform the market. The role of the fund manager of a passive investment is to track the value of: an index, for example the ASX200 or S&P500, a specific commodity, such as gold. The value of the ETF goes up or down with the index or asset they're tracking; Active ETFs and Hedge Funds: Exchange traded managed funds (also known as \u2018Active ETFs\u2019) and exchange traded hedge funds are actively managed investments. For these funds, investment managers may use high risk trading strategies to try to outperform an index; Physically-backed and synthetic ETFs: ETFs can be either physically-backed or synthetic. Physically-backed ETF \u2013 invests in all the securities in the index or a sample of the securities in the index. Synthetic ETF \u2013 hold some of the underlying assets and use derivatives to copy the movements of an index or asset. This type of ETF may use the word 'synthetic' in its name. Synthetic ETFs have an additional risk that the counterparty to the derivative could fail; What you can invest in through an ETF: ETFs are available for a range of asset classes and individual assets. These include: Australian shares, international shares, sectors of the Australian or international share market, such as mining or financials, fixed income investments like bonds, precious metals and commodities, foreign currencies, crypto assets, diversified across multiple asset classes. Visit the ASX or CXA websites for the ETFs you can invest in."}
{"text": "Pros and cons of investing in ETFs: Weigh up the pros and cons before you invest in ETFs. Pros: Diversification \u2013 ETFs allow you to buy a basket of shares or assets in a single trade. This can help to diversify within an asset class. ETFs also allow you to invest in markets or assets it can be difficult or expensive to access. You can also diversify across ETFs so there's less chance of loss if an ETF provider collapses. Transparency \u2013 ETFs publish the net asset value (NAV) daily. This can help you track how the underlying asset are performing and if the price of the ETF is close to the NAV. Most ETFs publish the list of assets owned by the fund, so you know exactly what the ETF is invested in. Low cost \u2013 a lot of ETFs have a low management expense ratio (MER). They're usually cheaper than equivalent managed funds. Easy to trade \u2013 you can buy and sell ETFs during the trading hours of the exchange, through a broker. You can typically buy smaller quantities of ETF units than unlisted managed funds; Cons: Market or sector risk \u2013 the market or sector the ETF is tracking could fall in value. For example, if the ASX200 declines, the value of your ETF investment will also fall. Currency risk \u2013 if the ETF invests in international assets, you face the risk of currency movements impacting your returns. Some ETFs are 'currency hedged' which removes this risk. Liquidity risk \u2013 some ETFs invest in assets that are not liquid, such as emerging market debt. This can make it difficult at times for the ETF provider to create or redeem securities. Tracking errors \u2013 an ETF's return may differ from the index or asset it's designed to track. This can be due to differences in the assets owned by the ETF and the index it is designed to track, fees, taxes and other factors. This means you could buy or sell when it's not trading at the indicative net asset value (iNAV)."}
{"text": "How to buy and sell units in ETFs: You can buy and sell units in an ETF through a stockbroker. It's the same as buying and selling shares. You buy and sell at the market price at the time of the trade. Settlement of trades takes place two business days after you buy or sell the ETF. You have to pay brokerage fees when you buy or sell an ETF.You may also be able to buy and sell units in the ETF fund directly with the ETF provider. These transactions will occur at the end of the day with a price reflecting the NAV of the units."}
{"text": "Compare the price and NAV or iNAV: You can check if an ETF is fairly priced by comparing its price on the ASX or Cboe with the NAV or the indicative or intraday NAV (iNAV).The NAV is calculated by taking the assets of the fund, subtracting the liabilities and dividing this by the number of units in the fund at the end of the day. The iNAV is a real-time estimate of the NAV, published during the day. ETF providers give updates of the NAV: on the ASX at the end of the day, generally on the ETF provider's website. The price to buy and sell an ETF should be close to the NAV per unit. But at times, such as on days with large changes in prices of the asset classes, the price of the ETF may move away from the NAV. You can use the iNAV as a reference point during the day to understand if an ETF you're buying or selling is at, or close to, the NAV per unit. You can see the latest iNAV from your broker by adding 'Y' before the ETF ticker. For example 'YABCD' for the ETF ticker 'ABCD'."}
{"text": "When to buy and sell ETF units: To get an ETF price that is more likely to represent its underlying value, place your trades at least 30 minutes after the market opens. It's also better to buy or sell ETFs when the market for the underlying asset is open. For example, if you're buying or selling an ETF that tracks Asian shares, place your orders when the Asian sharemarkets are open."}
{"text": "Check the product disclosure statement before you invest: A product disclosure statement (PDS) contains a lot of information you'll need to know about an ETF. It includes information on: what index, sector or asset the ETF returns aims to replicate, the fees and costs, how to buy or sell units in the ETF on market or, if allowed, directly with the ETF provider, the risks of investing in the ETF, how to complain if you have a problem with the ETF.

{"text": "Some companies listed on Australian exchanges have business operations or assets outside Australia. It pays to check where a company operates, so you can assess the risk of investing. Consider issues like language, distance and currency. There could be different standards of regulation, risk management, internal controls or auditing. Your investment may have less protection than under Australian law. More established markets include the United States, Hong Kong, Japan and New Zealand. Less established markets include other parts of Asia and the Pacific, Central and South America, Africa, Eastern Europe and The Middle East. Companies operating in these areas are known as 'emerging market companies'."}
{"text": "Work out what you want from your shares. Do you want regular income or just capital growth? If you want regular income, consider companies with a track record of paying high dividends.

{"text": "Start with an industry or business sector you know. This gives you a better chance of recognising if a company is strong or weak. See if the company you work for has an employee share scheme. This could give you access to discount shares. Look at the ASX list of companies or Cboe for a breakdown of sectors. Make a list of companies you're interested in. Then check: What is the company's position in the market? What competition does it face, and how does it compare to others in the sector? Are the goods and services it provides likely to be in demand in years to come? Are there opportunities for the company to grow in the future?"}
{"text": "Each sector of the market has its own pros and cons. Generally: Finance \u2014 Banks and other financial institutions usually offer steady income through high dividends. Resources \u2014 Mining companies offer potential for high capital growth, but tend not to give high dividends. This sector can be highly cyclical. It does well when the international economy is healthy, but badly when not. Consumer \u2014 Retailers offer medium-sized dividends. This sector tends to move up and down with the Australian economy. International \u2014 Gives you access to larger markets outside Australia. Enables investment in other sectors or asset classes, giving broader diversification. Potential for higher returns at times, along with greater exposure to volatility."}
{"text": "To decide if investing in Australian shares is right for you, consider the following: Pros: Potential capital gains from owning an asset that can grow in value over time. Potential income from dividends. Lower tax rates on long-term capital gains. Cons: Company share prices can fall dramatically, even to zero. If a company goes broke, you may not get your money back. The value of your shares will go up and down from month to month, and the dividend may vary."}
{"text": "If you're thinking about buying international shares, consider these pros and cons. Pros: You can invest in companies or industries not represented, or under-represented, in the Australian share market. Enables geographic diversification, so a slow-down in one market may have less impact on your portfolio. Cons: Greater volatility from movements in currency exchange rates. Regulatory or political changes could impact your investments. Delay in trades and information due to markets operating in different time zones.

{"text": "Start with the company's annual report. Get the current and last year's reports from their website so you can compare progress. An annual report is like a report card for a business. It tells you: core business activities, future prospects, whether the company is making a profit or loss, company strategy. Key things to look for in annual reports are: A proven track record \u2014 This year, has the company done what it said it was going to do in last year's report? If its strategy has changed, this could affect performance. When looking at how activities and earnings are reported, be aware that many companies have been significantly impacted by COVID-19. Valuable strategic acquisitions \u2014 If they are expanding by buying other businesses, will this add value? A new acquisition may give access to markets, technologies or products. This could affect the share price. Research gets results \u2014 Has spending on research and development led to something tangible? For example, the sale of new software or production of a high tech product. Profit or a good reason for no profit \u2014 Did the company make a profit or loss? If a loss, why? Many companies do not make a profit during their start-up phase. If this is the case, when does it expect to make a profit? Cash to pay for operating costs \u2014 Look at the cash flow. Has the company used its own money or borrowed funds? Borrowing includes loans or issuing convertible notes (debt securities that convert to shares). If it has issued more shares, this could dilute existing investor shareholdings. Enough cash to last \u2014 Is it generating revenue from its operations? If not, will it have enough cash to last until it does generate revenue? Or will it need to borrow money or raise more funds from investors?"}

{"text": "Comparing a company to its competitors is one way of assessing its value. No single measure will give you the answer, so use a range of sources. Here are some basic comparisons you can make: Earnings per share (EPS) \u2014 The part of a company's profit allocated to each share. The higher the EPS, the more a share could be worth. To get the EPS, see the company's website or annual report, or the ASX website. Price-earnings ratio (P/E) \u2014 A way of working out if the price of a share is over or under-valued compared to its competitors. In general, the lower the ratio, the better. A low ratio could also mean the market expects earnings to be lower in future. To work out the P/E ratio, divide the share price by the EPS. During times of higher market volatility, such as COVID-19, past earnings may not be indicative of future earnings. It can also be more difficult to forecast future earnings. So the P/E ratio may not be a reliable indicator. Look at other metrics. Dividend yield (%) \u2014 A company pays dividends from profits, so this can show how it's performing. Generally, a high yield is good. But it's not good if dividends come from borrowings. To work out the yield, divide the dividend per share by the share price."}
{"text": "One of the best ways to protect your portfolio is to diversify. That is, to spread your investments between different industry sectors.

{"text": "Bonds can provide a stable source of income and can protect the money you invest. They are considered less risky than growth assets like shares and property, and can help to diversify your investment portfolio."}
{"text": "What is a bond: When you invest in bonds, you\u2019re lending money to a company or government. In return, you get regular interest payments, called coupon payments. Bonds are generally viewed as a defensive asset and considered to be lower risk. They are still exposed to: Interest rate risk \u2013 the risk that a change in interest rates could reduce the market value of the bond. If interest rates rise, bonds offering lower coupon payment rates become less attractive investments, and Credit risk \u2013 the risk that the issuer could default or go insolvent. All bonds have a set value, called 'face value' when first issued. If you hold the bond until maturity, you get back the face value (or principal) of the bond. If you sell a bond before maturity, you\u2019ll get the market value. This could be lower than the face value. Market value is influenced by: interest rate movements, credit risk of the issuer, level of liquidity, and when the bond is due to be paid back. Watch out for imposter bond investment offers. Scammers pretend to be from well-known domestic or international financial service firms and offer high yield bond investments."}
{"text": "How to buy and sell bonds: The main issuers of bonds in Australia are the Australian Government and corporates. Always read the financial services guide and product disclosure statement (PDS) before you invest. Government Bonds: There are two types of Government bonds: Australian Government Bonds (AGBs) and Semi Government Bonds (Semis). Australian Government Bonds (AGBs): AGBs (also known as Treasury Bonds) represent sovereign debt issued by the Australian government. They guarantee a rate of return if held until maturity. Exchanged-traded Treasury Bonds (eTBs) give fixed interest payments. Exchange-traded Treasury Indexed Bonds (eTIBs) give interest payments linked to inflation. You can buy and sell listed AGBs on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) at market value. You must pay any brokerage fees. To find out more, take the ASX online Government Bonds course. Semi Government Bonds (Semis): Semis represent semi sovereign debt issued by Australian states and territories. They can only be bought and sold through state and territory treasury corporations; Corporate bonds: A corporate bond is a way for a company to raise money from investors to finance its business activities. Corporate bonds are primarily issued and traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market. The minimum amount required to buy corporate bonds is typically large, up to $500,000. Consider the credit risk of corporate bonds before you buy. If the company goes out of business, you won't get coupon payments and may not get your face value back. Before you invest in a corporate bond: It is rare for corporate bonds to be issued to the retail market (allowing purchases below $500,000). If someone offers you a corporate bond be wary as it could be a scam. For any corporate bond offer, check: Is the prospectus lodged on ASIC\u2019s offer notice board? If not, it is likely a scam. Is the offer or prospectus from a legitimate source? If you\u2019re not sure, go to the issuer\u2019s website to download the prospectus and application form (with bank account details). Is the bond available to you? Some bonds, such as green bonds, are not available unless purchased in a managed fund. Be cautious if someone offers you these types of investments. Scammers may pose as a corporate entity, like a bank, and offer 'Treasury bonds'. This is a red flag that it's a scam. Corporate entities issue bonds in their own name. Only the Australian Government can issue Treasury bonds."}
{"text": "Interest paid on bonds: Fixed rate bond: Interest rate is set when the bond is issued and stays the same until maturity. You get fixed coupon payments and the face value back if you hold it to maturity. You should choose it because it's a stable, regular income stream and to diversify a portfolio; Floating rate bond: Interest rate can go up or down over the term of the bond. The coupon rate is based on an underlying interest rate, plus a specified percentage or margin (for example, cash rate + 2%). You get coupon payments which rise if interest rates go up, but fall if interest rates go down, You et the face value back if you hold it to maturity. You should choose it for a stable income and protected returns if interest rates rise, as the coupon payment rate adjusts; Indexed bond: Returns are indexed against the consumer price index (CPI) which protexts against rising inflation. You get both coupon payments and the face value increase in line with changes in the CPI. You should choose because indexed bonds protect against inflation (which can reduce your returns) and diversify a portfolio."}
{"text": "How to work out the value of a bond: Yield to maturity (YTM) is a useful measure of the value of a bond. It is also a good way to compare what you'll get by investing in different bonds. YTM calculates the average annual return of a bond from when you buy it (at market value) until maturity. It assumes that you reinvest coupon payments in the bond at the same interest rate the bond is earning. Make sure you always balance the return against any risks before investing."}

Weigh up the risks and decide if it's the right investment for you. If you need help to understand property schemes, consider getting advice from a licensed financial adviser."}
{"text": "How property schemes work: A property scheme is where you buy 'units' in an investment run by a professional investment manager. They pool your money with that of other investors and invest it in property assets. These may include commercial, retail, or industrial assets. The investment manager selects and buys investment properties. They are responsible for maintenance, administration, rental collection and improvements to the properties. Some schemes invest in property development, which means there are construction and development risks. Depending on the type of scheme you invest in, you might get a regular income (distributions). These may be paid quarterly or half-yearly. You may also get a capital gain on your investment, if the value of the scheme's underlying assets increase. Check the product disclosure statement: The product disclosure statement (PDS) tells you how the property scheme works. Read the PDS to understand: the features and risks of the investment, the fees you will pay, who will be managing the trust."}
{"text": "Listed versus unlisted property schemes: Listed property schemes: These are also called 'property trusts' or 'real estate investment trusts' (REITs). Property schemes listed on a public market, such as the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), are: easier to value, as you can see what each unit is worth at any point in time, easier to sell if you no longer want the investment, subject to market listing rules; Unlisted property schemes: An unlisted property scheme does not list on a public market. This means: you can't easily see whether the value of your investment is going up or down, it's not subject to ongoing supervision by a market supervisor, such as the ASX, it can be difficult to get out of if you want to withdraw your money early, if you can withdraw your money, it may be subject to strict conditions and fees."}
{"text": "How to assess the risks of property schemes: Investment managers for unlisted property schemes must report on benchmarks set by ASIC, and disclose how the property scheme meets them. If the scheme does not meet these, they must explain why and how this affects risk. Listed property schemes do not have to report on these benchmarks but they can still provide a good checklist to assess the scheme's risk. To check how risky a property scheme is, look at: Gearing \u2013 What the scheme owes (its debts) versus what it owns (its assets). Look for the investment manager's policy on gearing for each loan it has. Interest cover \u2013 Can the scheme meet its interest payments from its earnings? Look for the investment manager's policy on interest cover for each loan it has. Interest capitalisation \u2013 For scheme loans, if it pays interest during or at the end of the loan period (capitalised). If it is capitalised, how the scheme will be able to repay the interest and capital. Scheme borrowing \u2013 The key terms on any loan and when the scheme must pay it's debts. Portfolio diversification \u2013 The number, value, sectors and locations of the properties the scheme is investing in. Valuation policy \u2013 How and when the property scheme values its underlying assets. Related party transactions \u2013 The number and value of loans, investments and other transactions the scheme has with related parties. Look for the investment manager's policy on related party transactions. Distributions \u2013 If the scheme pays distributions from income received. If not, how it pays income payments and whether they can continue long term. Withdrawing from the scheme \u2013 Whether you can withdraw from the scheme and under what conditions. Net tangible assets \u2013 The scheme's net tangible asset backing per unit and what this means to an investor. To see how a fund is performing against these benchmarks, look at the fund's annual report. You can find this on their website."}

The deposit (or 'margin') you give to the provider is a small part of what you borrow to invest. A CFD contract is legally binding. If the market goes against you, the CFD provider: will ask you to pay extra money at short notice to keep your CFD position open (a 'margin call').

There are significant investment risks as currency fluctuations may move against you, causing you to lose money.; Currency markets are extremely difficult to predict.

{"text": "If you're invited to join an employee share scheme, you may be able to buy shares at a discount on the current market rate. Schemes vary, so check the offer terms and consider the pros and cons before you sign up."}
{"text": "How an employee share scheme works: In an employee share scheme, you get shares or can buy shares in the company you work for. This is also known as an employee share purchase plan, share options or equity scheme. Companies use share schemes to attract, retain and motivate employees. They also align employee interests with those of shareholders. There are different ways of paying for shares, such as: salary sacrifice over a set period (say, 6 months), dividends received on shares, a loan from your employer, full payment up front. You may be eligible to receive shares as a performance bonus, or as remuneration instead of a higher salary. Larger companies typically offer 'ordinary shares', which give an equity investment in the company. In a smaller company, you may get dividends only, which means you don't get other shareholder rights, such as a vote at the annual general meeting."}
{"text": "What to check before you sign up: Research the company to see how well it's doing and whether the shares are likely to increase in value. See choosing shares to buy for guidance on how to do this. Each share scheme is different, so look at the terms and conditions of the offer. Check: when you can buy or sell the shares, if you will receive, dividend payments, what happens to your shares if you leave the company, the tax benefits (see employee share schemes on the Australian Taxation Office website). Ask questions if there's anything you're unsure about. Consider your personal circumstances and financial goals. Can you afford to buy shares at this point? Or do you have other priorities like paying off your mortgage faster or contributing extra to super? If you decide to go ahead, think about how you can diversify to spread your investment risk. What if your shares fall in value? Or the company you work for goes out of business? If you need professional advice, talk to an accountant or financial adviser."}
{"text": "Pros and cons of employee share schemes: Pros: You benefit financially if the company performs well. It could motivate you to stay longer with the company. You may be able to buy shares at a discount to current market price. You may not have to pay a brokerage fee when you buy or sell shares. You could get tax benefits, depending on the features of the share scheme and your financial situation. Cons:  There are likely to be limitations on when you can buy or sell shares. If you're paying for a share package over time, you might have to pay it off before you can sell the shares. You may have to give back or sell your shares when you leave the company. Your share package could come with restrictions. For example, you may have to meet performance targets, or stay with the company for a certain number of years. You could lose money if your shares go down in value or the company goes out of business."}

{"text": "What is insider trading?: Insider trading is when you trade in a financial product (for example, shares, options or derivatives of a listed company) while knowing information that is not public. Your trade could impact the value or price of the investment. It\u2019s also insider trading if you act on sensitive information that could affect the value of a company\u2019s competitor or supplier. When you have inside information, it is also illegal to recommend, suggest, or ask others to buy, sell or even not to trade the investment. Also, you must not tip off anyone who would be likely to trade on that information. Examples of inside information include: details of an upcoming takeover or merger, details of upcoming financial results, knowledge of major customer contracts or strategic partnerships, knowledge of changes in executive leadership or board restructure. Even if you trade on inside information and it turns out to be false, you can still be charged with insider trading. You could also be charged if you tried to get someone else to trade for you, even if that person did not act on it."}
{"text": "Who has access to inside information?: Company insiders are often the source of inside information. They typically include the Board of directors, the executive management team, and staff with access to sensitive information (for example, they work in the finance department). Other people who may have access to inside information are those advising a company on a fundraising transaction or other confidential company business. They may include financiers, consultants, brokers, lawyers, and major shareholders."}
{"text": "Penalties for insider trading: The Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC) monitors Australian markets in real-time for insider trading and other market misconduct. By combining trading data with other data sources, ASIC can identify traders, networks of connected parties and analyse trading patterns. If you are found guilty of insider trading, you may face up to 15 years in prison. You could be fined up to $1.565 million or three times the profits gained, or the loss avoided, whichever is greater. You could also be disqualified from managing a company for up to 5 years. The penalties for insider trading are even greater for companies."}
{"text": "Why insider trading is illegal: Insider trading undermines fairness and trust in Australia\u2019s financial markets. It has impacts beyond those who invest directly in financial products, for example, those who have superannuation.  In a transparent market all participants should receive access to information at the same time. Someone who uses non-public price sensitive information to trade gains a financial advantage over the rest of the market. Australia has one of the cleanest financial markets in the world and maintains this through tight legal restrictions."}
{"text": "How to avoid insider trading: As an individual: Do your own research and make your investment decisions based on publicly available information.; Never trade based on inside information received from others.; If you come across inside information, do not share that information with others, and do not act on that information yourself. As a finance professional or company insider: Familiarize yourself with your company\u2019s share trading policy, blackout periods and trading windows.; Do not share sensitive information about the company with others.; If you are a director or major shareholder, disclose your trades and holdings to the market to ensure transparency."}

{"text": "Hedge funds use investment strategies that are more complex than other managed funds. Many aim for positive or less volatile returns, in both rising and falling markets. A hedge fund is a complex investment and risks vary. Read the product disclosure statement and consider getting financial advice before you invest."}
{"text": "How hedge funds work: Hedge funds ('absolute return' funds) use pooled funds to invest in alternative assets or strategies. This may include the use of derivatives, alternative investments or leverage in domestic and international markets. Hedge fund returns may depend less on traditional assets, like shares and bonds. This can make it a good way to diversify a portfolio. A hedge fund may aim to deliver positive or less volatile returns, in both rising and falling markets. It could try to outperform a benchmark, such as a market index or interest rate. Or achieve a benchmark return with less volatility."}
{"text": "Hedge fund features: There are different types of hedge funds. The features and risks of each depend on: fund strategy, what assets it invests in, where assets are, investment tools used, fund manager's knowledge and skill. See the fund's product disclosure statement (PDS)."}
{"text": "Investment tools: Common investment tools include: Leverage \u2014 When a fund increases its exposure to certain assets or strategies, usually through borrowing. Leverage can increase returns, and increase losses. Derivatives \u2014 Securities whose value depends on an underlying asset such as a share, commodity or index. Used to manage risk. And gain or reduce exposure to assets, markets or events. Enables an investor to buy or sell an asset in the future, based on an agreed price. Short selling \u2014 An investor borrows a security from another party (a broker), then sells it on the market. The investor aims to buy an identical security at a lower price and return it to the lender. And hopes to profit from the difference between buy and sell prices. Alternative investments \u2014 Investing in assets such as high yield bonds, synthetic assets, derivatives, unlisted shares or other hedge funds. Active management \u2014 The fund manager decides what to invest in, and how much. The manager's expertise is crucial to the fund's success."}
{"text": "Fund of hedge funds: A 'fund of hedge funds' is a fund that invests in other hedge funds. It may invest all or some money in other hedge funds. When a fund invests in another hedge fund, the underlying fund is usually not open to retail investors. The underlying fund may be offshore, with less monitoring. A fund of hedge funds may have extra risks. For example, it may invest in multiple hedge funds, across assets and markets. This can make it harder to know where the fund invests your money, and what the risks are. You may also have to pay more fees."}
{"text": "Pros and cons of hedge funds: To decide if investing in hedge funds is right for you, consider the following: Pros: Targeted strategies \u2014 A fund may target less volatile returns, so it loses less in a down market. This may be at the expense of gains in a rising market. Or mean a risk of greater losses. So consider your appetite for risk when choosing a fund. Asset diversification \u2014 Can expose you to a broader range of asset classes and markets. This can help diversify your portfolio. And reduce exposure to downturns in some asset classes or markets; Cons: Leverage risk \u2014 A fund may have an exposure greater than 100% of the assets invested. So, if markets move against the fund's position, it could lose a lot. Derivatives and short selling both involve leverage risk. Liquidity risk \u2014 Investing in assets not traded on an open market makes them harder to sell or value. If an asset devalues, it may be hard to sell fast if you want to get your money back. A fund of hedge funds may not be able to exit the underlying funds quickly. This makes it harder to redeem your money at short notice. Concentration risk \u2014 Concentrating assets in a single market means a greater risk of losses, if that market underperforms. Complex structure risk \u2014 May be hard to work out how the fund invests your money. And the risks you are taking on. Counterparty risk \u2014 Derivatives could be purchased 'over the counter' by agreement with another party. That party may fail to honour the agreement."}
{"text": "What to check before you invest in a hedge fund: Read the product disclosure statement: Hedge funds vary in risk and complexity. The fund manager will give you a PDS before you invest. This sets out the features, benefits, costs and risks of the fund. Make sure you understand the investment before you go ahead; Check your understanding of the fund: Use these questions to check your understanding of the fund: Strategy \u2014 What are the investment goals? How will the fund achieve these goals? Investment manager \u2014 Who manages the fund? Does the manager have relevant skills and experience? Local or international \u2014 Does the fund invest in Australian or overseas assets? If overseas, have foreign currency risks been hedged? Past performance \u2014 Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. But it can give you an idea of how the fund has performed, in rising and falling markets. Look at medium to long-term performance (over 5 to 10 years). Third party service providers \u2014 Does the fund uses third party service providers? If so, are they licensed in Australia? Or elsewhere, where financial regulations may be less strict? Fees \u2014 How are fees charged? Does this offer an incentive for the fund manager to take extra risks? Does charging of a performance fee depend on the fund outperforming a benchmark? If so, is the benchmark appropriate? Will returns, after fees, justify any additional risks taken? Structure \u2014 How are the investments structured? As a test, how easily could you explain this to someone else? Redemptions \u2014 How quickly can you redeem your investment from the fund? Is there a minimum time your money must stay in the fund? Is there a minimum redemption amount? When you redeem, do you have to pay an exit fee?; Get advice if you need it: Talk to a financial adviser if you need help deciding if this investment is right for you."}
{"text": "Crypto-assets (crypto) mean digital assets including cryptocurrencies, coins or tokens. They digitally represent your ownership of a value or rights to something. They may or may not be backed by physical assets. Crypto is a high-risk investment. The value of crypto is very volatile, often fluctuating by huge amounts within a short period. More than with any other investment, you must be prepared to lose what you invest."}
{"text": "How crypto works: What is crypto?: Crypto-assets (crypto) describe an asset class that includes cryptocurrency, digital tokens and coins. It does not exist physically as coins or notes, but as digital tokens stored in a digital \u201cwallet\u201d. These digital tokens rely on cryptography and technology such as blockchain for security and other features. Crypto may or may not have an actual asset behind it. The Reserve Bank of Australia's website explains how cryptocurrency and blockchain technology (including mining) works. Crypto is used for payment systems, to execute automated contracts, and run programs. Anyone can create a crypto-asset, so at any time there can be thousands in circulation; Why crypto is so volatile: The price of crypto can fluctuate at extreme levels often based solely on market speculation. Factors that can influence the price of crypto include: media focus, public announcements, individuals with large amounts of a crypto-asset who promote or influence it through social media. So if you buy crypto-assets, be prepared to lose everything that you put in; How crypto is used: Cryptocurrencies were first developed as a digital currency to use as money. Some stores accept crypto as payment for goods and services. Some ATMs let you withdraw it as physical money. But crypto is not legal tender in Australia and is not widely accepted as payment. Most people don\u2019t use it for everyday transactions. It is not the sort of investment to use to build your savings. Once you invest there are no regulatory restrictions on how your funds are used. In some cases, your funds may be used for other investments, such as loans. This may jeopardise your investment; Buying and storing crypto: You can buy or sell crypto on a trading platform using money. Or buy or sell it directly. Crypto is kept in a unique digital or software wallet (hot) or hardware (cold) wallet. Each wallet has private keys (unique codes) that authorise transactions on the blockchain network. A hardware wallet stores these private keys on a secure device not connected to the internet. This can protect the wallet from hackers. A software wallet is held by an individual or by a crypto trading platorm on your behalf. This can simplify buying, selling and storing crypto, but is not a regulated service. So you may not be able to recover the crypto if the trading platform fails; Types of crypto-assets: Each crypto-asset has different capabilities. Most were not created to be investments. There are no universally defined categories of crypto-assets. Some common types are listed below, but this does not cover them all. New cryptos are created all the time, but many aren\u2019t well structured and don\u2019t last."}
{"text": "Cryptocurrencies: What are they: Assets designed to act as a medium of exchange, with transfers enabled on blockchains. Cryptocurrencies have no intrinsic value and are only worth what people are willing to pay for them. Examples include: BTC, ETH, Litecoin."}
{"text": "Stablecoins: What are they: A \u2018Stablecoin\u2019 is a marketing term for crypto that aims to maintain a stable value relative to a specified asset, or basket of assets. Many aim to track the value of a government issued currency (for example, USD). Some track other assets such as gold, equities, bonds or other crypto. Stablecoins try to stabilise their market value by: being physically backed 1-for-1 by an external asset, such as government-issued currency, gold or securities, being physically backed by a variety of assets where the value of these assets is intended to be greater than the value of the Stablecoin on issue, using algorithms to control the available demand and supply of the asset, such as minting additional assets or changing an interest rate for holding the asset.  Examples include: Tether, USDC, TrueAUD, DAI"}
{"text": "Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): What are they: NFTs are tokens which record ownership of an object using blockchains. Each NFT is unique (hence they are not \u2018fungible\u2019). However, owning an NFT may not give you exclusive rights to the underlying asset. Examples include: Board Apes, game tokens"}
{"text": "DeFi tokens: What are they: These are tokens created through participating in decentralised finance (DeFi) protocols. Each token will have unique features based on the DeFi protocol that it relates to."}
{"text": "Other token types: There are a broad range of terms for other types of tokens. Some types include: utility tokens \u2014 allow you to undertake certain activities, or perform an action, in a crypto project, such as being exchanged for a service, governance tokens \u2014 these allow you to participate in the running of a crypto project, community (or membership) tokens \u2014 ownership gives you access to the community"}
{"text": "Why investing in crypto is high-risk: Crypto is largely not regulated: Many crypto-assets and other digital assets are not commonly considered to be financial products. Because of this, the platform where you buy and sell crypto may not be regulated by ASIC. So you may not be protected if the platform fails or is hacked. When a crypto-asset fails, you will most likely lose all the money you put in. In most countries, crypto is not legal tender. You're only protected to the extent that crypto fits within existing laws. The value depends largely on popular opinion. Investing in crypto-assets is highly speculative. The market value can fluctuate a lot over short periods of time. It is affected by things like media hype and investor opinion. The price of unbacked crypto may depend on: its popularity at a given time (influenced by factors like the number of people using it), how easy it is to trade or use, the perceived value of the currency, its underlying blockchain technology; Your money could be stolen: Be aware that a hacker can potentially steal the contents of your digital wallet. Crypto systems allow users to stay relatively anonymous and there is no central data bank. So if a hacker steals your crypto, you have little hope of getting it back. Using a wallet held offline, a \u2018hardware wallet\u2019 or \u2018cold storage\u2019, may offer more protection; Technically complex: Crypto-assets can be hard to understand. There is usually no product disclosure statement or prospectus that explains clearly how the crypto works. Developers may issue a \u2018whitepaper\u2019 to describe it, but these can vary in format and information. A crypto-asset\u2019s code may not be available to review. Or it may be written in obscure computing language. The underlying code of the crypto may also change over time. To access a crypto network, you may need special software and need to know how transaction fees operate. Unfamiliar users run the risk of: sending a transaction to an incorrect address, over-paying on transaction fees called \u2018gas\u2019 (sometimes by thousands of dollars), not paying enough for a transaction fee (and so losing the fee and transaction); Crypto scams are increasing: Scammers use crypto because transactions are not easy to recover and have limited oversight. Money can quickly be sent overseas and is very hard to trace."}
{"text": "The most common way to buy and sell shares is by using an online broking service or a full service broker. When shares are first put on the market, you can buy them via a prospectus. You can also buy through an employee share scheme, or invest indirectly through a managed fund."}
{"text": "How investing in shares works: Buying shares (stocks, securities or equities) makes you a part-owner of a company. As a shareholder, you can get dividends and other benefits. You can own shares yourself, or pool your money with others through a managed fund (a collective investment). If you're new to shares, visit the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) education centre for information and online seminars."}
{"text": "Using a broker to buy and sell shares. You can choose to use an online broking service or a full service broker. Online broking service: You open an online trading account and make your own investment decisions. Because you do it yourself, fees are lower. You pay a fee each time you buy or sell shares \u2014 starting at around $20. Full service brokers: The broker does the trading for you, and can advise you on what to buy or sell. They must have a reasonable basis to recommend something to you, and disclose any interest they have in it. Fees are a percentage of the value of a trade. Typically, the larger the transaction, the lower the percentage you pay. Most brokers charge a minimum fee. For example, the fee on a transaction of up to $5,000 may be 2.5%. For a large trade, it may be 0.1%. So, small trades worth a few thousand dollars can be relatively expensive. Find a broker: Use the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) find a broker tool to locate a broker that suits your needs."}
{"text": "Companies may offer new shares to the market as a way of raising capital. This is called a 'float' or an 'initial public offering' (IPO). Get the prospectus To decide whether to invest in an IPO, read the prospectus . A prospectus contains details about the company and the float. It tells you: features of the shares (securities) on offer, how many are for sale, how to apply to buy company information, its operations and financial position risks associated with the offer A prospectus must be lodged with ASIC. To check this, see ASIC's Offer Notice Board. Prospectus checklist Things to look for in a prospectus: Sector \u2014 How well do you understand the sector the company operates in? Competitors \u2014 Who are the company's competitors? How does it compare to others in the sector? Financial prospects \u2014 Look at the financial statements and cash flow. Is it generating revenue and making a profit? If not, why? Many companies do not make a profit during their start-up phase. If this is the case, when does it expect to make a profit? Profit estimate \u2014 Are the assumptions underlying the profit estimates reasonable? For example, demand for goods or services produced, or assumed economic conditions. What if they vary? Consider your investment time frame and how this would affect you. Relative value \u2014 What is the price-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of the company? How does this compare to its competitors? The P/E ratio will help you assess whether the IPO is a fair price. Generally, a higher P/E ratio means investors expect higher growth. During times of higher market volatility, such as COVID-19, past earnings may not be indicative of future earnings. It can also be more difficult to forecast future earnings. So the P/E ratio may not be a reliable indicator. Look at other metrics. Dividends \u2014 Does the company intend to pay a dividend? If so, when? Purpose of float \u2014 How will the company use the funds raised through the IPO? Licences \u2014 Does the company have all the necessary licences and permits to operate? If not, when? Directors \u2014 Are the company directors and managers paid what you would expect for the size and industry? Do they have appropriate skills and experience? Check they are not on ASIC's banned and disqualified register. Advisers \u2014 How much are independent advisers paid as a percentage of funds raised by the IPO? If the fees exceed 10%, consider whether this is reasonable. The more money paid to advisers, the less available to the company. Risks \u2014 Is the risk disclosure section detailed and specific to the company? Or does it use vague language and generalised disclosure (such as saying the share price may go down)? This could mean the company is not telling you everything you need to know. If there's anything in the prospectus you don't understand or are unsure about, talk to a broker or financial adviser before you invest."}
{"text": "Crowd-sourced funding (CSF) enables start-ups and small to medium-sized companies to raise public money to finance their business. This is also known as 'equity crowd funding' or 'crowd-sourced funding of shares'. Different from crowd funding Crowd-sourced funding of shares is not the same as: Donation-based crowd funding \u2014 This is typically used by artists or entrepreneurs to raise money for one-off projects. Investment-based crowd funding \u2014 This may involve investing in a managed investment scheme. Or it could be offered by someone who doesn't need an Australian financial services (AFS) licence. How crowd-sourced funding of shares works There's an annual investment cap \u2014 You can invest up to $10,000 per year in a company in exchange for shares. You need to understand the risk warning \u2014 If you invest through a CSF website, you need to declare that you understand the risk warning on the company website and offer document. Intermediaries need a licence \u2014 Check that the CSF website operator has an AFS licence on ASIC Connect's Professional Registers. Look at 'licence authorisation conditions' to make sure it can provide CSF services. There's a cooling-off period \u2014 You have five business days to cancel if you decide the investment is not for you. During this time, you can withdraw your application and get a full refund. Risks of crowd-sourced funding Lack of company track record \u2014 Some businesses using crowd-sourced funding are in the early stages of development. So there's a higher risk that they will be unsuccessful and you could lose the money you invest. Do your own research on the company. Use the CSF portal to ask questions about the company or investment. Shares may fall in value or be hard to sell \u2014 The value of your investment could fall. Your returns may decrease if the company issues more shares. Your investment is unlikely to be 'liquid'. So if you need to get your money back, you may not be able to sell your shares quickly \u2014 or at all. Fraud or insolvency \u2014 You could lose the money if the website operator handles your money inappropriately or becomes insolvent."}

{"text": "Consider takeover bids carefully. In a takeover, one company makes an offer to take control of another company. They try to buy enough shares to run meetings and decide who gets elected as directors. If you own shares in the target company, the takeover company could offer you cash, shares or a combination of these. The offer could be a takeover bid, a scheme of arrangement or a backdoor listing (reverse takeover)."}
{"text": "Takeover bid: Once the bid is announced, you get a written offer to buy your shares within two months. You will receive a: bidder's statement \u2014 who the bidder is, what it does, what it will do if the takeover is successful, how much it is offering for your shares, target company's statement \u2014 usually recommends whether to accept or reject the offer, and why, Wait until you've received both statements, review them, then decide whether to accept or decline the offer. If you accept, you sell your shares directly to the bidder and do not pay a brokerage fee. You get the cash and/or shares within 21 days of bid closure. If you decline, you generally do not have to sell your shares to the bidder. But if the bidder gets 90% or more of the company, it could compulsorily acquire them under bid terms. Things can move quickly during a takeover, so watch for updates. The offer price may go up or the bid period could be extended. Changes in the share price may also indicate whether the market thinks a takeover will succeed."}
{"text": "Scheme of arrangement: Within a few months of the announcement, you will receive a scheme booklet from the company you hold shares in. It will include: who is acquiring your shares, and how much you will get, if offering shares in the company buying your shares, what both companies will look like when merged. The booklet may also include an independent expert report, giving an unbiased assessment of the offer. This explains the pros and cons, whether the scheme is 'fair and reasonable', and what are the implications if the scheme goes ahead or not. Review the scheme booklet, and consider if it's in your best interests. Then decide whether to vote for or against. You can vote in person at the scheme meeting or send in your proxy form. You get to vote on the offer, and the company acquires your shares if shareholders accept the scheme. The scheme goes through an approval process before you get the cash and/or shares."}
{"text": "Backdoor listing: In a backdoor listing (reverse takeover), a listed company acquires an unlisted company in exchange for cash and/or shares. The listed company may have few assets or be no longer viable. The takeover allows the unlisted company to become listed without an initial public offering (IPO). The listed company can re-emerge as a new business and work towards creating value for shareholders. A backdoor listing may take longer and cost more than an IPO, and be more difficult to understand. Share trading is suspended while the process takes place. Some shareholders may not be able to sell shares within 12 to 24 months of the takeover. As a shareholder in the unlisted company, you get cash and/or shares in the listed company in exchange for your shares. As a shareholder in the listed company, you may benefit from an increase in value of your shares. Or your interest in the company could be diluted as more shares are issued."}
