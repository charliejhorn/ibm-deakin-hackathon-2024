{"text": "Track your dividends: Share dividends are distributed to shareholders from company profits, usually twice a year. The size of the dividend depends on how the company performs. Sometimes you don't receive any dividends. Some types of companies pay more dividends than others. For example, financial companies typically pay more than mining companies."}
{"text": "Keep a record of transactions: Hang on to your transaction statements. Like any income, you need to include dividends on your tax return. You can also find details of dividends per share on the company website or the ASX."}
{"text": "Claim franking credits: A 'franking credit' is your share of the tax a company has paid on profits you receive as a dividend. This is also known as an imputation credit. It means you get a credit on your tax return."}
{"text": "Reinvest what you can afford: A company may offer you more shares instead of a cash dividend, sometimes at a discounted price. This is known as a dividend reinvestment plan, and still counts as income on your tax return. Before you take up the offer, think about what you want from your shares. Do you want regular income or capital growth? Consider using your dividends to invest in different shares or other assets to diversify and spread your investment risk."}
{"text": "Keep your holding statements: When you buy or sell shares in a company, you will receive a holding statement. Keep these as proof of ownership and for tax purposes. You need this paperwork to work out capital gains tax."}
{"text": "Keep records for your tax return: Records to keep for your tax return include: records of sales and purchases, dividend statements, any dividends that have been reinvested, participation in a bonus share scheme.

{"text": "Binary options promise quick, high returns. But the reality is you will lose your entire investment most of the time. Binary options are financial products that bet on the outcome of an event. If you pick correctly, you get a fixed cash payout. If you get it wrong you lose your entire investment. An ASIC review found that around 80% of retail clients lost money trading binary options."}
{"text": "How binary options work: Binary options are also known as 'all-or-nothing options', 'fixed return options' or 'digital options'. They allow you to make bets on share prices, foreign exchange movements, markets or economic events. For example, you could bet on whether the share price of a company will be trading above its current price in one hour. Contract times for binary options are usually very short. They range from a few minutes or hours, to a few months in the future. Trading binary options may seem simple. But picking the short-term movements of an underlying asset is extremely difficult, even for professionals. They are high-risk and speculative. When you trade binary options, you're gambling on the movement of an asset price."}
{"text": "Risks of binary options: Binary options promise quick, high returns if you pick the correct price movement. The reality is, if the price doesn't move in the direction you chose, you'll lose 100% of your investment. An ASIC review found up to 80% of binary option investors lost money."}
{"text": "ASIC also found that binary options are likely to result in cumulative losses to retail clients over time because of the product's characteristics: the 'all or nothing' payoff structure, where one of the two possible outcomes for a binary option contract is that the retail client will lose their entire investment, short contract duration (the average contract duration of binary options traded with one provider was less than six minutes), negative expected returns (that is, the present value of the expected payoff for a binary option contract is lower than the initial amount invested)."}
{"text": "Wholesale clients lose consumer protections: Some firms may try to classify you as a 'wholesale client', rather than a 'retail client'. They could ask you to sign up to a 'pro-account' and speak about the benefits to you. However, if you're a wholesale client you: waive your right to access the binary option provider's internal dispute resolution service, will not have access to external dispute resolution through the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA), may not receive a Product Disclosure Statement or Financial Services Guide for the binary option."}
{"text": "Scams involving binary options: There are scammers who use binary options to steal your money. Be very cautious if you receive a phone call or see an ad online or through social media offering binary options trading. If you invest through an unlicensed overseas company and something goes wrong, you won't be able to get help."}
{"text": "Hybrid securities are a way for banks and companies to borrow money from investors. They are complex investments that can be very risky. Get financial advice before investing in hybrids."}
{"text": "How hybrid securities and notes work: Companies, banks and insurers issue hybrid securities and notes. They are complex financial products that combine the features of bonds and shares. They can provide income, like a bond, but their value can fall dramatically, like shares. Hybrids can also have features that impact the future value of your investment. Even experienced investors can struggle to understand the risks and features of some hybrids. Hybrids generally pay a fixed or floating rate of return until a specified date. However there's no guarantee on the amount and timing of interest payments. Each hybrid is unique and the names used to describe them may not be consistent. It's important to read the prospectus to check the specific features of each hybrid before investing. Hybrids may not be suitable for you if you need steady returns or capital security. Take the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) online hybrids course to learn more about hybrid securities."}
{"text": "The difference between bank and corporate hybrids: Bank hybrids: Banks issue hybrids that are 'loss absorbing'. If the bank has financial difficulties, they can convert the hybrids to bank shares. The shares may be worth less than your initial investment, or written off completely. This means investors, not the bank, are at risk of suffering a loss. This protects the bank's depositors, at the expense of hybrid investors; Corporate hybrids: When you buy a corporate hybrid you lend money to a company in return for regular interest payments. But the company can defer interest payments for years and may not repay your capital for decades. Corporate hybrids are also known as 'subordinated notes'. This means corporate hybrid investors get paid last if the company becomes insolvent. Interest payments may also be held back until other debts are paid. Listed and unlisted companies can issue corporate hybrids. You can: buy and sell listed hybrids on a securities exchange such as the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), and buy unlisted hybrids directly from the issuer. You can't trade them on the ASX, which means they are harder to sell and harder to value."}
{"text": "The risks of hybrid securities and notes: Hybrids have different levels of risk, which depend on the features of the individual hybrid. Here are some of the most common risks: Liquidity \u2013 there are fewer buyers and sellers in the market for hybrids. If you need to exit the investment in a hurry, you may have to accept a lower price.; Interest payments deferred \u2013 some hybrids have features that allow the issuer to withhold interest payments if they get into financial difficulty.; Last to be paid \u2013 you can be the last to get your money back if the company becomes insolvent. There may not be any money left for you after other creditors are paid.; Can convert to shares \u2013 this can happen when the value of the bank or company falls. The shares may be worth less than your initial investment.; Long maturity dates \u2013 investment terms can last decades. The longer the maturity, the greater chance the company might default on its obligations or run into financial difficulties.; Not guaranteed \u2013 unlike savings accounts or term deposits with a bank, the Government guarantee doesn't cover hybrids.; 'Knock out' options \u2013 some hybrids are written off completely if the issuer gets into financial difficulty. This means you'll lose all the money you've invested."}
{"text": "What to check before investing in a hybrid security: Understand the features and risks of any hybrid before investing. You can get these details from the prospectus. Make sure you can answer the following questions: What are the risks of investing in this hybrid security, now and in the future?; Will the returns compensate for the investment risk?; How does the interest rate compare with other investments? Can other less complex or risky long-term investments provide a similar or better return?; Does the issuer have to pay interest? Do missed payments accumulate?; What is the maturity date? Can the issuer repay the investment early?; Are there any 'trigger events' where your hybrid may convert into ordinary shares, or written off completely?; Will this product help you achieve your financial goals and objectives?; Does it suit your investment timeframe and personal risk profile?; Can you leave this investment if your circumstances change?"}
