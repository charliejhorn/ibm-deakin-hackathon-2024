{"instruction": "What steps should I take to monitor my investments?", "response": "Keep track of your investments by maintaining organized records and reviewing them regularly to ensure alignment with your financial goals. For shares, set up a 'watch list' to monitor prices, dividends, and company announcements. For managed funds, read the fund's annual statement and check performance updates on their website. For property investments, monitor market trends and property values through real estate websites and financial reports. Be aware of warning signs such as financial and accounting problems, management issues, and public statements from regulatory bodies. Before selling any investment, review its performance and consider if it still aligns with your financial objectives."}

Within each asset class, invest in various sectors to mitigate risk. For example, in shares, consider sectors like financials, resources, healthcare, and energy. Investing overseas can also provide diversification benefits, as different markets may perform well at different times. Utilizing managed funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or listed investment companies (LICs) can offer diversified exposure to various assets and sectors."}
{"instruction": "What are the risks of borrowing to invest?", "response": "Borrowing to invest, also known as gearing or leverage, is a high-risk strategy. While it can amplify returns when markets rise, it can also magnify losses when markets fall. You are obligated to repay the loan and interest regardless of investment performance. Major risks include larger potential losses, capital risk if the investment's value decreases, income risk if the investment doesn't generate expected returns, and interest rate risk if borrowing costs increase. This strategy is generally suitable only for experienced investors who fully understand the associated risks."}
