{"instruction": "What is borrowing to invest?", "response": "Borrowing to invest, also known as gearing or leverage, involves using borrowed funds to purchase investments. This strategy can amplify returns when markets rise but also magnify losses when markets fall. It's a high-risk approach suitable primarily for experienced investors."}
{"instruction": "What are the key risks of borrowing to invest?", "response": "Key risks of borrowing to invest include: 1) Increased returns and losses - Borrowing can lead to higher returns in a rising market but larger losses if the market declines. 2) Capital risk - If the value of your investment decreases, you may owe more than the investment is worth. 3) Income risk - The investment might not generate the expected income, affecting your ability to cover loan repayments. 4) Interest rate risk - An increase in interest rates can raise borrowing costs, impacting the profitability of your investment."}
{"instruction": "What is negative gearing?", "response": "Negative gearing occurs when the income from an investment is less than the expenses, including interest on the loan. This results in a loss, which can sometimes be used to reduce taxable income. However, making a loss means the investment is costing you money. The strategy relies on the investment's value increasing over time to offset these losses."}
{"instruction": "What should I consider before borrowing to invest?", "response": "Before borrowing to invest, consider the following: 1) Assess your financial situation to ensure you can meet loan repayments without relying solely on investment income. 2) Understand the risks, including the potential for significant losses and the impact of interest rate changes. 3) Seek professional advice from a licensed financial adviser to determine if this strategy aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance."}
